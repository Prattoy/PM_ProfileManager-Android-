# PM_ProfileManager-Android-
It's a profile manager for any android device.
If you start the manager it will change the profile of your phone from 'Loud' to 'Vibrate' to 'Silent' depending on some specific situations.
If your phone is on a flat surface, it has nothing above it and the light is more than 40 lux then the profile would be 'Loud'. 
And if the light is less than 40 lux then it will be 'Vibrate'.
If your phone is in your hand and your face is above it, then the profile would be 'Silent'. (Because, you don't need any sound then)
If you keep your phone in your pocket then the profile would be 'Vibrate'.
After stopping the app the profiles would not change again.
So, these are the conditions to change the profile of your phone.
Enjoy.
